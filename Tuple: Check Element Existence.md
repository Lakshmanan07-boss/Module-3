# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
Add code here
```
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 10)

print("'n' exists in tuple:", 'n' in x)
print("8 exists in tuple:", 8 in x)
```
## Output

## Result
The program successfully checked and confirmed that both 'n' and 8 exist in the tuple.
